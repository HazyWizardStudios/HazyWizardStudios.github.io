                <li>Always give The Player what THEY want. Everything from gameplay, features and UI. have toggle options in a menu</li>
                <li>No Microtransactions, no DLC, only old-school style Expansions.</li>
                <li>Generally, design for PVP first.</li>
                <li>If there are choices, they MUST be meaningful</li>
                <li>RPG games will be based on the system we have (currently called Crown and Blood) and stay faithful to that.</li>
                <li>Stylized is usually more appropriate than realistic.</li>
                <li>Player shouldn't be confused about what to do or where to go. In-game journal if needed.</li>
                <li>Don't go crazy with the budget, keep prices reasonable. Aim for comparatively low prices, therefore offering lots of value.</li>
                <li>An extension of #1, appeal to casuals and ultra hardcore players. Simple but Deep.</li>
                <li>Devs should be enthusiastic. Avoid using purely mercenaries.</li>
                <li>Give players great rewards.</li>
                <li>Rule of Cool, almost always, but be consistent.</li>
                <li>Don't chase fads. Reference old games and non-video games.</li>
                <li>EXCELLENT music. go ALL OUT.</li>
                <li>Always make a demo. No stupid CGI trailers!</li>
                <li>Don't make things long just for the sake of it. No filler.</li>
                <li>Games should usually be replayable.</li>
                <li>Games should be complete and run well on release. Early Access if needed.</li>
